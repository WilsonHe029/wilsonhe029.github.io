## Part 1: Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way

  </div>
</div>

Here are two selfies of mine. A close-up selfie (figure 1) looks weird because the camera is too near. This warps the picture such that the parts of my face closest to the camera, like my nose, look unnaturally large, while parts farther away, like my ears, look smaller. To fix this, I stand several feet back and zoom in to frame my face (figure 2). Taking the picture from farther away makes my facial features look properly balanced and more like they do in real life.

## Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression

    <p><strong>Figure 3: Himeji Castle from Far Away</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/images/IMG_9048.jpeg" alt="Figure 4" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p><strong>Figure 4: Himeji Castle Up Close</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>

Here are two photos of the Himeji castle, one of the grandest castles in Japan. Figure 3 was taken from a significant distance using a long zoom lens. This technique renders the scene flat, where the zoom lens squashes the distance between the castle and the foreground elements, making the castle seem small. Figure 4 was taken with a wider-angle lens closer to the castle. This photo shows a strong sense of scale and depth, where the wide view exaggerates the distance between the foreground and the castle (especially the Tenshukaku, the rightmost and tallest tower), making the structure feel immense and towering.

## Part 3: The Dolly Zoom

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

    <p><strong>Figure 5: Dolly Shot</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>

Here is a dolly-zoom GIF on an Lego Ferrari F1 car. As I moved the camera towards the car I simultaneously zoomed the lens out. The car remains the same size and in sharp focus in the frame, while the world behind the car appears to stretch, expand, and recede. The perspective becomes warped, making the background feel like it's pulling away, which create a dramatic sense of dizziness.

*Behind the Scenes*: An actual "dolly" (the McLaren F1 car) was used to stabilize my phone while moving towards the Ferrari car.

*Fun fact*: Ferrari F1 Team suffered a double retirement in the Dutch Grand Prix the morning after I created this dolly shot.
